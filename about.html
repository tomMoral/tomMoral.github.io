	<p>
        I am a researcher in the parietal team @ INRIA Saclay, since autumn 2019, working on unsupervised learning for time series and on deep learning methods applied to solving inverse problems.
	</p>

	<p>
        My research interests touch several areas of Machine Learning, Signal Processing and High-Dimensional Statistics. In particular, I have been working on Convolutional Dictionary Learning, studying both their computational aspects and their possible application to pattern analysis. I am also interested in theoretical properties of learned optimization algorithms such as LISTA, in particular for the resolution of inverse problems.
        </p>

	<p>
	I did my PhD under the supervision of Nicolas Vayatis and Laurent Oudre, in the CMLA @ ENS Paris-Saclay. My PhD focuses on convolutional representations and their applications to physiological signals. I continued working on unsupervised learning for time series with application to electrophysiological recordings during a 1,5 year in the Parietal Team. I am also involved in open-source projects such as <span class="highlightcode">joblib</span> or <span class="highlightcode">loky</span>, for parallel scientific computing, and <span class="highlightcode">benchopt</span>, for reproducible benchmarks in optimization.

                Human neuromagnetic activity is characterised by a complex combination of transient bursts with varying spatial and temporal characteristics. The characteristics of these transient bursts change during task performance and normal ageing in ways that can inform about underlying cortical sources. Many methods have been proposed to detect transient bursts, with the most successful ones being those that employ multi-channel, data-driven approaches to minimize bias in the detection procedure. There has been little research, however, into the application of these data-driven methods to large datasets for group-level analyses. In the current work, we apply a data-driven convolutional dictionary learning (CDL) approach to detect neuromagnetic transient bursts in a large group of healthy participants from the Cam-CAN dataset. CDL was used to extract repeating spatiotemporal motifs in 538 participants between the ages of 18-88 during a sensorimotor task. Motifs were then clustered across participants based on similarity, and relevant task-related clusters were analysed for age-related trends in their spatiotemporal characteristics. Seven task-related motifs resembling known transient burst types were identified through this analysis, including beta, mu, and alpha type bursts. All burst types showed positive trends in their activation levels with age that could be explained by increasing burst rate with age. This work validated the data-driven CDL approach for transient burst detection on a large dataset and identified robust information about the complex characteristics of human brain signals and how they change with age.

                The quantitative analysis of non-invasive electrophysiology signals from electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) boils down to the identification of temporal patterns such as evoked responses, transient bursts of neural oscillations but also blinks or heartbeats for data cleaning. An emerging community aims at extracting these patterns efficiently in a non-supervised way, e.g., using Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL). Using low rank atoms, mulit-variate CDL is able to learn not only prototypical temporal waveforms, but also associated spatial patterns so their origin can be localized in the brain, which leads to an event-based description of the data. Given these events and patterns, a natural question is to estimate how their occurrences are modulated by certain cognitive tasks and experimental manipulations. To address it, we consider a Point-Process (PP) approach. While PP have been used in neuroscience in the past, in particular for single cell recordings (spike trains), techniques such as CDL makes them amenable to human studies based on EEG/MEG signals. We develop a novel statistical PP model – coined driven temporal point processes (DriPP) – where the intensity function of the PP model is linked to a deterministic point process corresponding to stimulation events. Results on MEG datasets demonstrate that our methodology allows to reveal event-related neural responses – both evoked or induced – and isolate non-task specific temporal patterns.
