	<p>
        I am a researcher in the parietal team @ INRIA Saclay, since autumn 2019, working on unsupervised learning for time series and on deep learning methods applied to solving inverse problems.
	</p>

	<p>
        My research interests touch several areas of Machine Learning, Signal Processing and High-Dimensional Statistics. In particular, I have been working on Convolutional Dictionary Learning, studying both their computational aspects and their possible application to pattern analysis. I am also interested in theoretical properties of learned optimization algorithms such as LISTA, in particular for the resolution of inverse problems.
        </p>

	<p>
	I did my PhD under the supervision of Nicolas Vayatis and Laurent Oudre, in the CMLA @ ENS Paris-Saclay. My PhD focuses on convolutional representations and their applications to physiological signals. I continued working on unsupervised learning for time series with application to electrophysiological recordings during a 1,5 year in the Parietal Team. I am also involved in open-source projects such as <span class="highlightcode">joblib</span> or <span class="highlightcode">loky</span>, for parallel scientific computing, and <span class="highlightcode">benchopt</span>, for reproducible benchmarks in optimization.

                Temporal point processes (TPP) are a natural tool for modeling event-based data. Among all TPP models, Hawkes processes have proven to be the most widely used, mainly due to their simplicity and computational ease when considering exponential or non-parametric kernels. Although non-parametric kernels are an option, such models require large datasets. While exponential kernels are more data efficient and relevant for certain applications where events immediately trigger more events, they are ill-suited for applications where latencies need to be estimated, such as in neuroscience. This work aims to offer an efficient solution to TPP inference using general parametric kernels with finite support. The developed solution consists of a fast L2 gradient-based solver leveraging a discretized version of the events. After supporting the use of discretization theoretically, the statistical and computational efficiency of the novel approach is demonstrated through various numerical experiments. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is evaluated by modeling the occurrence of stimuli-induced patterns from brain signals recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Given the use of general parametric kernels, results show that the proposed approach leads to a more plausible estimation of pattern latency compared to the state-of-the-art.

                The quantitative analysis of non-invasive electrophysiology signals from electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) boils down to the identification of temporal patterns such as evoked responses, transient bursts of neural oscillations but also blinks or heartbeats for data cleaning. An emerging community aims at extracting these patterns efficiently in a non-supervised way, e.g., using Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL). Using low-rank atoms, multivariate CDL is able to learn not only prototypical temporal waveforms but also associated spatial patterns so their origin can be localized in the brain, which leads to an event-based description of the data. Given these events and patterns, a natural question is to estimate how their occurrences are modulated by certain cognitive tasks and experimental manipulations. To address it, we consider a Point-Process (PP) approach. While PPs have been used in neuroscience in the past, in particular for single-cell recordings (spike trains), techniques such as CDL makes them amenable to human studies based on EEG/MEG signals. We develop a novel statistical PP model – coined driven temporal point processes (DriPP) – where the intensity function of the PP model is linked to a deterministic point process corresponding to stimulation events. Results on MEG datasets demonstrate that our methodology allows revealing event-related neural responses – both evoked or induced – and isolates non-task-specific temporal patterns.

            The aim of this project is to provide a robust, cross-platform and cross-version implementation of the <span class="highlightcode">ProcessPoolExecutor</span> class of  <span class="highlightcode">concurrent.futures</span>. It features:</br>
<ul> <li> <b>Deadlock free implementation</b>: one of the major concern in standard <span class="highlightcode">multiprocessing</span> and <span class="highlightcode">concurrent.futures</span> libraries is the ability of the <span class="highlightcode">Pool/Executor</span> to handle crashes of worker processes. This library intends to fix those possible deadlocks and send back meaningful errors.</li></br>
<li><b>Consistent spawn behavior</b>: All processes are started using <span class="highlightcode">fork/exec</span> on POSIX systems. This ensures safer interactions with third party libraries.</li></br>
<li><b>Reusable executor</b>: strategy to avoid respawning a complete executor every time. A singleton pool can be reused (and dynamically resized if necessary) across consecutive calls to limit spawning and shutdown overhead. The worker processes can be shutdown automatically after a configurable idling timeout to free system resources.</li></ul></br>
